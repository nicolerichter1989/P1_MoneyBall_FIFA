### change format and rename
all lower string
spaces replaced with underscore
clean up â‚¬,K,M formats from value, wage, release_clause and hits columns

### drop columns
I decided to drop following columns from the dataframe
images/links: player_photo, club_logo, flag_photo
gender: only one gender represented in the data
position columns: to evaluate the value of the player I only considered the best position to be important

### set player ID as index

### add calculated columns
I decided to add 2 rankings:
- potential within best position
- potential within age

### null values
check and deal with null and zero values

After cleaning FIFA 21 dataset contains 28 columns and 17,125 rows
